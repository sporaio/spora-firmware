/**
 *  \brief
 *  Defines the data structure used to maintain information about the queue.
 *
 *  The queue is a buffer-like object through which state machine
 *  applications (SMA) and ISRs send and receive messages to communicate and
 *  synchornize with data. It temporarily holds pointer to messages from a
 *  sender until the intended receiver is ready to read them.
 *
 *  The number of messages a queue can hold depends on its message size
 *  (pointer size) and the size of the memory area supplied during creation.
 *  To calculate the total message capacity of the queue, divide the number
 *  of bytes in each message into the total number of bytes in the supplied
 *
 *  The memory area for buffering messages is specified during queue
 *  creation. It can be located anywhere in the target's address space.
 *  This is an important feature because it gives the application
 *  considerable flexibility.
 *
 *  \note
 *  RKH prohibits an application from explicitly modifying the RKH_QUEUE_T
 *  structure. The RKH's queue structures can be located anywhere in memory,
 *  but it is most common to make it a global structure by defining it
 *  outside the scope of any function.
 *  An RKH queue is created when an queue (copy by reference) is declared
 *  with the RKH_QUEUE_T data type. The following listing declares "gsmque"
 *  timer:
 *
 *  \code
 *  RKH_QUEUE_T gsmque;
