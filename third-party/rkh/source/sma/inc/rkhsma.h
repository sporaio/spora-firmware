/**
 *  \brief
 *  Declare and allocate a SMA (active object) derived from RKH_SMA_T. Also,
 *  initializes and assigns a state machine to previously declared SMA.
 *
 *  In the UML specification, every state machine has a top state
 *  (the abstract root of every state machine hierarchy), which contains
 *  all the other elements of the entire state machine. RKH provides the
 *  top state using the macro RKH_SMA_CREATE().
 *	Frequently, RKH_SMA_CREATE() is used within state-machine's module
 *	(.c file), thus the structure definition is in fact entirely encapsulated
 *	in its module and is inaccessible to the rest of the application.
 *	However, use RKH_SMA_DEF_PTR() or RKH_SMA_DEF_PTR_TYPE() macros to 
 *	define a opaque pointer or typed pointer to that state machine application 
 *	structure, respectively. Also, use the RKH_SMA_DCLR() macro to declare it 
 *	to be for the rest of application code. 
 *  RKH_SMA_T is not intended to be instantiated directly, but rather
 *  serves as the base structure for derivation of state machines in the
 *  application code.
 *  The following example illustrates how to derive an state machine from
 *  RKH_SMA_T. Please note that the RKH_SMA_T member sm is defined as the
 *  FIRST member of the derived structure.
 *
 *  \param[in] type 	Data type of the SMA. Could be derived from RKH_SMA_T.
 *  \param[in] name		Name of state machine application. Also, it represents 
 *                      the top state of state diagram.
 *  \param[in] prio		State machine application priority. A unique priority
 *                      number must be assigned to each SMA from 0 to
 *                      RKH_LOWEST_PRIO. The lower the number, the higher the
 *                      priority.
 *  \param[in] ppty		State machine properties. The available properties are
 *                      enumerated in RKH_HPPTY_T enumeration in the rkh.h
 *                      file.
 *  \param[in] initialState
 *                      Pointer to initial state. This state could be defined
 *                      either composite or basic (not pseudo-state).
 *  \param[in] initialAction
 *                      Pointer to initialization action (optional). The
 *                      function prototype is defined as RKH_TRN_ACT_T. This
 *                      argument is optional, thus it could be declared as
 *                      NULL.
 *  \param[in] initialEvt
 *                      This parameter is now deprecated and not recommended 
 *                      for new designs. It remains supported for backwards 
 *                      compatibility.
 *
 *  \sa RKH_SM_CONST_CREATE(), RKH_SM_GET_CONST(), RKH_SM_GET_CONST(),

 *	{

 *  The following example illustrates how to derive an active object from
 *  RKH_SMA_T. Please note that the RKH_SMA_T member ao is defined as the
 *  FIRST member of the derived struct.
 *
 *	Example:
 *	\code

 *		rui8_t x;		// private member

/**
 *  \brief
 *	Defer an event to a given separate event queue.
 *
 *  Event deferral comes in very handy when an event arrives in a
 *  particularly inconvenient moment but can be deferred for some later time,
 *  when the system is in a much better position to handle the event. RKH
 *  supports very efficient event deferring and recalling mechanisms.
 *  This function is part of the event deferral mechanism. An SMA
 *  uses this function to defer an event \a e to the event queue \a q.
 *  RKH correctly accounts for another outstanding reference to the event
 *  and will not recycle the event at the end of the RTC step.
 *  Later, the SMA might recall one event at a time from the
 *  event queue by means of rkh_sma_recall() function.
 *
 *  \param[in] q    pointer to previously created queue.
 *  \param[in] e    pointer to event.
 *
 *	\note
 *	For memory efficiency and best performance the deferred event queue,
 *	STORE ONLY POINTERS to events, not the whole event objects.
 *  An SMA can use multiple event queues to defer events of
 *  different kinds.
 *	The assertion inside it guarantee that operation is valid, so is not
 *	necessary to check the value returned from it.
 *
 *  \usage
 *	\code
 *	static RKH_QUEUE_T qurc;
 *	static RKH_EVT_T *qurc_sto[ MAX_SIZEOF_QURC ];
 *
 *	rkh_queue_init( &qurc, qurc_sto, MAX_SIZEOF_QURC, NULL );

 *	ring( const struct rkh_t *me, RKH_EVT_T *pe )

 *		rkh_sma_defer( &qurc, pe );	// defer event
