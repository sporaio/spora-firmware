 *  \note
 *	The rkh_hook_idle() callback is called with interrupts locked, because the

 *
 *	Usually, this hook allows to the application to extend the functionality
 *	of RKH, giving the port developer the opportunity to add code that will
 *	be called by rkh_tmr_tick(). Frequently, the rkh_hook_timetick() is
 *	called from the tick ISR and must not make any blocking calls and must
 *	execute as quickly as possible.
 *
