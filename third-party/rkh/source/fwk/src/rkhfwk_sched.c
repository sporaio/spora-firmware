/**
 *  \brief
 *  This function executes one state machine application or active object 
 *  at a time in the infinite loop (similar to the "superloop").
 *
 *  \details
 *	The RKS executes one state machine application or active object at a time
 *	in the infinite loop (similar to the "superloop"). The RKS is engaged
 *	after each event is processed in the run-to-completion (RTC) fashion to
 *	choose the next highest-priority active object ready to process the next
 *	event. The RKS scheduler is cooperative, which means that all active
 *	objects cooperate to share a single CPU and implicitly yield to each other
 *	after every RTC step. The kernel is nonpreemptive, meaning that every
 *	active object must completely process an event before any other active
 *	object can start processing another event. The ISRs can preempt the
 *	execution of active objects at any time, but due to the simplistic nature
 *	of the RKS, every ISR returns to exactly the preemption point. If the ISR
 *	posts an event to any active object, the processing of this event won't
 *	start until the current RTC step completes. The maximum time an event for
 *	the highest-priority active object can be delayed this way is called the
 *	task-level response. With the nonpreemptive RKS, the task-level response
 *	is equal to the longest RTC step of all active objects in the system.
